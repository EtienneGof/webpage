Welcome ! On this website you will find informations about myself. I am a PhD student (currently in 2nd year) at [LIPN](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/), the Computer Science Laboratory of [Sorbonne - Paris Nord University](https://www.univ-paris13.fr/). 

This thesis is conducted throught a CIFRE industrial research agreement with the car manufacturer [Groupe Renault](https://group.renault.com/) and its main objective is the development of analytical tools for the validation of autonomous driving behaviors. My research interests include, but are not limited to, time-series unsupervised classification, model-based analysis and scalable algorithms. 

Prior to this position, I have worked for several years at [Inria Lille](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-lille-nord-europe) Research Center as a Technology Transfer Engineer, and before that at Decathlon as a Data Engineer.
